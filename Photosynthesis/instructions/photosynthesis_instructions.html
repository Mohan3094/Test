        <li>
          Using a hole punch, punch holes on the leaf surface (between the major veins). Prepare about 40 - 50 leaf disks.
        </li>
        <li>Make sure that the leaf disks are of uniform size and are not damaged. </li>
        <li>
          Use a syringe without a needle. Place 10 of these leaf disks inside a syringe. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Now gradually push the plunger of the syringe inward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently draw a small amount of the CO2 solution (from beaker A) through the syringe tip.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tap the syringe to dislodge disks that are stuck to the sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold the syringe vertically, with the tip pointed upwards.
        </li>
        <li>Push in the plunger to expel the trapped air.</li>
        <li>
          Close the tip of the syringe with your finger and pull on the plunger to create a vacuum for 10 - 15 seconds. This will expel the gas from the leaf. You will notice that the leaf disks begin to sink in the syringe.
        </li>
        <li>Gradually release the plunger of the syringe. This will enable entry of the CO2 liquid into the leaf disk.</li>
        <li>Repeat this cycle (step 7, 8, 9, and 10) for 3 times.  This increases the density of the disks causing them to sink.</li>
        <li>Hold the syringe above beaker A. </li>
        <li>Pull the plunger out to decant the syringe contents into the beaker. You will notice that the leaf disks will sink to the bottom of the beaker.</li>
        <li>Place the beaker slightly away from the light source.</li>
        <li>Turn on the light source and start the timer. Observe the setup for 5 minutes. Note down the number of disks that float during this time period.</li>
